# **Azure-Keyvault-Secret-Locator**
The entire purpose of this script is to simply locate a secret in an environment which contains many key vaults. In some cases the sheer number of secrets inside a key vault, or simply the number of key vaults in an environmnt can make finding a specifc secret a bit painful. This will enumerate key vaults for which you have access to, and present you with a list of secrets. From that list of secrets you can select one to get that secret information right in your terminal.
